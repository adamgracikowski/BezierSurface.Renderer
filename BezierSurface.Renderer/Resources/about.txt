Bezier Surface Renderer is a simple application that allows for visualizing and manipulating a 3rd-degree BÃ©zier surface loaded from text files.
Users can apply various rotations to the surface, draw it in a triangular mesh form, and fill the mesh with color based on different lighting models.

The project was completed as part of the Computer Graphics course at the Warsaw University of Technology during the winter semester of the 2024-2025 academic year.
